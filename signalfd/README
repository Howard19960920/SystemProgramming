System Software Programming Homework #10
Descrption: Use signalfd to intercept at least 3 kinds of siganls and print it on the screen.

My program can detect signals:

  1. SIGINT ( ctrl+c )
  2. SIGQUIT( ctrl+\ )
  3. SIGTSTP( ctrl+z )

As for the others signals, my program "can" detected it too, but I will print out a message to tell
the user that this program is originally designed for detecting the above 3 signals once again.

The result has been tested right on my computer which is of the OS of Ubuntu 16.04.

*Both of gcc and clang compiler has no error message when compiling.
*Both of the execution file has the correct result of executions.
